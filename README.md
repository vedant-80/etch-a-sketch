# Etch-a-Sketch

More JS practice recreating a sketchpad for the Odin Project

## Description

This website acts as a sketchpad. Whenever the user hovers over the canvas, a pixel on the canvas is marked as the color selected. There are also options to change the dimensions of the canvas (each pixel gets smaller the greater the dimension), and an option to clear the canvas.

## What I learned

This wasn't too hard to make because I knew about loops and data-types coming into this. If I didn't it certainly would've taken way longer. I think what took me the most debugging time was getting the canvas size to change, but I had to move around the event listener. Overall, loops and data-types were the most important in this!
